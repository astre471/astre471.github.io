ASTRE, the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Rocket Enthusiasts of New York, is Section 471 of the [National Association of Rocketry (NAR)](http://www.nar.org).

ASTRE has been active in the Capital District, Mohawk Valley and surrounding areas since 1986. We have members from the entire region.

We welcome anyone with an interest in rocketry and space modeling to share in our activities.
If you live in or near the Capital District and enjoy building and flying rockets, 
then we invite you to [join us]({{ site.url }}/join/). Our membership spans all ages. Families are most welcome. 
Membership in the NAR is not a requirement, and ASTRE is open to all.

See you on the field! ðŸš€
