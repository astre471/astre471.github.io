ASTRE conducts about 6 launches per year - see below for the schedule.

New to rocketeering?  See what [items we recommend]({{ site.baseurl }}/launches/what-to-bring) to bring to a launch.

# Competition/Sport Launches

Sport launches are purely for fun - launch as many or as few as you like, or show up and watch as a member or guest!

[NAR-recognized Competition launches](https://www.nar.org/contest-flying/competition-guide/nar-rocketry-competition/) are to help you improve
your model rocket skills and designs.  There are a couple launches per year sponsored by ASTRE that are NAR-recognized.

## Membership Required to Attend

If you're interested in attending a launch, [join today]({{ site.baseurl }}/join/)!  Only ASTRE members or their guests can attend launches.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Per the terms designated by the Fairgrounds, launches are **not** open to outside spectators. Sorry!

If you are a member and wish to invite non-members as guests for a particular launch, 
send a request to [info@astre471.org](mailto:info@astre471.org) at least 5 days before the launch.

<!-- MAS: TODO there was also a request to invite someone by sending an email to the group.io -->
<!-- MAS: I think there was a limit on the number of guests per year, not sure if that's a real limit or not -->

The launch site is the parking field for the Washington County Fairgrounds. 
Look to the west of the Fair buildings in Greenwich, NY.

> :warning: There are *no bathrooms* on the launch site.  The nearest bathrooms are at a Stewart's
convenience store about 5 minutes driving distance from the launch site - plan accordingly!

## Maximum Motor Size & Weight

The maximum motor impulse for this launch site is full G(*).  Maximum launch weight is 3.3 pounds.

(*) Some G motors are not classified as "model rocket motors" because of propellant type and cannot be used at this launch site.
