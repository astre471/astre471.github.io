# Competition/Sport Launches

Sport launches are purely for fun - launch as many or as few as you like, or show up and watch as a member or guest!

[NAR-recognized Competition launches](https://www.nar.org/contest-flying/competition-guide/nar-rocketry-competition/) are to help you improve
your model rocket skills and designs.  There are a couple launches per year sponsored by ASTRE that are NAR-recognized.

## Membership Required to Attend

If you are a member and wish to invite non-members as guests for a particular launch,

The launch site is **NEW** for 2023:

  89 Anuszewski Lane
  Greenwich, NY

Park off the road as much as possible. This is a private property where the owner is permitting us to launch this year, so
please be courteous and pick up after yourself!

> :warning: There are *no bathrooms* on the launch site.  The nearest bathrooms are at a Hannaford
grocery store about 6 minutes driving distance from the launch site - plan accordingly!

## Maximum Motor Size & Weight

The maximum motor impulse for this launch site is full G(*).  Maximum launch weight is 3.3 pounds.

(*) Some G motors are not classified as "model rocket motors" because of propellant type and cannot be used at this launch site.
Check the [motor classification](https://www.nar.org/standards-and-testing-committee/nar-certified-motor-list/) on
the [National Association of Rocketry website](https://www.nar.org).


## Go/No Go Decision

If there are high winds or storms expected for the launch date, the launch will be canceled.
The Rain Date Launch is *only* held if the primary date is canceled.

ðŸš€ The Final [-Go-] / [-NoGo-] Status will be shared on the groups.io mailing list
and posted on this site the evening before the event, usually before 8 PM.
