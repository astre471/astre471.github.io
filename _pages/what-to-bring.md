If this will be your first time launching model rockets, that's awesome!  You're in for a treat,
and don't worry about being super prepared.

There are a few required items and a few highly recommended.  Others are completely optional,
but will make your first experience more comfortable and enjoyable.

See below on what to bring, from most to least important.

## Required Items
 * Your model rockets - of course!
 * Rocket engines - recommend 'B' or 'C' engines to start, depending on your rockets
 * Recovery wadding - to prevent the parachute from burning up
 * Rocket Engine Igniters - to start your engines

If you've never built a model rocket before, try a [almost ready-to-fly rocket starter set](https://estesrockets.com/product/rocket-science-starter-set/)
with included engines, wadding, and igniters all in one kit.

## *Highly* Recommended Items
 * Sunglasses
 * Hat or head protection
 * Sunscreen & bug spray
 * Drinks & food

## Recommended Items
 * Foldable chairs
 * Pop-up canopy (10' by 10' or smaller works best for shade)

our launch site.

 * Grill - not allowed
